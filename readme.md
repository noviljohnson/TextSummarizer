## Text Summarizer

### Usecase Description
    Develop a backend service that leverages AI to summarize content typed by the user. This service should use Python and Flask/Django as the backend framework. It will interact with Elasticsearch/Pinecone/(any comfortable database) for storing and retrieving content metadata and use SQL database for user data management (unique user ID, login if needed). (Can use a pre-trained model from Huggingface or any public AI model).  

    Use Git to submit the project to a private Github repository to demonstrate an understanding of Version Control. Also provide comprehensive documentation on how to access, set up, interact, and run the project with a brief overview.  

    Expectation: 

    路       API development and Database Integration: storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. 

    路       Readable code quality and structure. 

    路       Successful integration of AI model. 

    路       Documentation and clarity of thought.
