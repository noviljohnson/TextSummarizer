## Text Summarizer

### Usecase Description
    Develop a backend service that leverages AI to summarize content typed by the user. This service should use Python and Flask/Django as the backend framework. It will interact with Elasticsearch/Pinecone/(any comfortable database) for storing and retrieving content metadata and use SQL database for user data management (unique user ID, login if needed). (Can use a pre-trained model from Huggingface or any public AI model).  

    Use Git to submit the project to a private Github repository to demonstrate an understanding of Version Control. Also provide comprehensive documentation on how to access, set up, interact, and run the project with a brief overview.  

    Expectation: 

    路       API development and Database Integration: storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. 

    路       Readable code quality and structure. 

    路       Successful integration of AI model. 

    路       Documentation and clarity of thought. 



### Introduction
This document provides a brief overview of the AI-powered content summarizer backend, which is a service that leverages AI to summarize content typed by the user. The service is built using Python and Flask as the backend framework, and it interacts with Elasticsearch for storing and retrieving content metadata and uses SQL database for user data management.


### Repository Structure
summarizer.py: 
Contains the Flask application code, including the API endpoints and the integration with the AI model.
Contains the SQL database models for managing user data.
Contains unit tests for the API endpoints and the database models.

requirements.txt: Contains the required dependencies for the project.
app.py: Streamlit code for frontend UI.
Chroma_db : Vector Database, Contains user input text, embedding and metadata
UserDb.db : Sqlite Database, Contains user details.

### Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
Clone the repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/noviljohnson/TextSummarizer.git`


Create a virtual environment: Create a virtual environment for the project using the following
Command: `conda create -n envname python=3.10.9`


Activate the virtual environment: Activate the virtual environment using the following 
Command: `conda activate  envname`


Install the dependencies: Install the required dependencies for the project using the following
Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


Run the application: Run the application using the following command:

` python summarizer.py   # starts flask server`

` streamlit run app.py   # in another cmd`


### API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available in summarizer.py :
GET / login : Checks credentials of the user to login.
Inputs : user email, password
GET / update_user : Creates a new user.
Inputs : user email, password, full name
[GET,  POST ] / get_summary : 
Summarizes the content provided in the request body and returns the summary.
Also returns the answer if the user asks a question instead of text to summarize. 
Inputs : user email, input text
All inputs will be passed in json format




### AI Model Integration
The AI models used in this project are the LaMini-Flan-T5-248M and Intel/dynamic_tinybert model from Hugging Face. It is integrated into the application using the transformers library.

### Database Integration
The application uses Chroma Vector Database  for storing and retrieving content metadata and uses SQLite3 database for user data management.

### Code Quality and Structure
The code is structured in a way that makes it easy to read and understand. The code is organized into modules, and each module is responsible for a specific functionality. The code is also well-documented, with comments and docstrings that explain the code and its functionality.
